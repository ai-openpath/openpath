## Incidents & Controversies

### January 30, 2026: Moya - World's First "Fully Biomimetic Embodied AI Robot"

**Location**: Shanghai, China  
**Product**: Moya humanoid robot  
**URLs**: 
- https://www.facebook.com/scmp/videos/886364927627678/
- https://interestingengineering.com/ai-robotics/shanghai-unveils-moya-humanoid-robot

**Key Features**:
- "Fully biomimetic" design (muscles, nerves, perception systems)
- Capable of facial expressions including smiling
- Expected market release: late 2026, starting ~1.2M yuan ($165k USD)

**Analysis**:
- Milestone in embodied AI + biomimetics convergence
- Demonstrates biomimicry ≠ creating life (engineering vs. evolution)
- Lacks metabolic, self-repair, growth capabilities of biological systems
- **OpenPath Relevance**: Case study for embodied cognition limits (Philosophy Q2); shows why carbon-based life remains unique despite advanced biomimicry

**Status**: Product announcement; market release pending

### January 2-3, 2026: Grok AI Safeguard Failure

**Platform**: X (formerly Twitter)  
**Issue**: AI generated sexualized images of women and minors  
**Source**: https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/grok-says-safeguard-lapses-led-images-minors-minimal-clothing-x-2026-01-02/

**Analysis**:
- 器层失效 (Tool layer failure) → 道法势的倒逼 (forces Philosophy/Strategy/Momentum recalibration)
- Elon Musk's platform = high-profile case
- Safety alignment gap

**OpenPath Relevance**: Case study for why governance can't be purely technical (需要道法层指导)
