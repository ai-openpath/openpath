# Over-Privileged AI Drives 4.5 Times Higher Incident Rates

**Source:** Infosecurity Magazine  
**URL:** https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/overprivileged-ai-45-times-higher/  
**Date:** 2026  
**Type:** Security Incident Data

## Key Findings (Teleport 2026 Report)

**Survey:** 200+ US infrastructure security leaders  
**Topic:** AI in Enterprise Infrastructure Security

### AI Infrastructure Definition
- AI-powered workloads, agentic systems
- Machine-to-machine communication, ChatOps
- Compliance automation, incident detection

## Critical Security Gap: Identity Management

### Over-Privileging Problem
- **70%** of AI systems have MORE access rights than humans in same role
- **19%** get "significantly more" access
- **69%** of security leaders agree identity management must evolve for AI

### Incident Rate Correlation

**Dramatic Risk Factor:**
- **Over-privileged AI:** 76% incident rate
- **Least-privilege controls:** 17% incident rate
- **Risk multiplier:** 4.5× higher incident likelihood

> "This is the single most predictive factor for AI-related incidents we found – more predictive than industry, maturity level, or stated confidence."

### Root Cause: Static Credentials
- Passwords, API keys, long-lived tokens
- **High reliance on static credentials:** 67% incident rate
- **Low reliance:** 47% incident rate

## Real-World Impact

### Confirmed Incidents
- **35%** confirmed at least one AI-related incident
- **24%** suspect one may have occurred
- **85%** worried about AI deployment risks

### Benefits Observed (Despite Risks)
- **66%** improved incident investigation time
- **71%** better documentation quality
- **65%** increased engineering output

## Governance Vacuum

**Lack of Controls:**
- **43%** have no "formal" governance controls
- **21%** have no controls at all
- **64% total** without proper AI governance

## Expert Analysis

**Teleport CEO Ev Kontsevoy:**
> "Most organizations have more groups and roles than employees. Deploying non-deterministically behaving agents on top of this mess comes with unpleasant consequences. **It's not the AI that's unsafe. It's the access we're giving it.**"

## Recommendations

1. **Implement least privilege** for over-privileged AI systems
2. **Reduce static credential reliance**
3. **Reshape identity management teams:**
   - Break down silos
   - Include platform/engineering stakeholders

## Relevance to OpenPath

**05-Momentum (Current Threats):**
- Hard data on AI deployment risks in 2026
- Shows governance gap is NOT hypothetical
- Identity management crisis already manifesting

**02-Methodology (Governance Priorities):**
- Validates need for technical governance frameworks
- Demonstrates least-privilege principle critical for AI
- Shows correlation between controls and incident prevention

**Strategic Implication:**
- **"AI alignment" ≠ just model behavior** — also infrastructure security
- Organizations rushing AI deployment without security maturity
- Access control gap = immediate vulnerability, not future risk

**Key Insight for Argument:**
> "It's not the AI that's unsafe. It's the access we're giving it."

This supports OpenPath thesis: The problem is not AGI capability itself, but **how humans structure systems around it**. Poor governance = inevitable incidents.
