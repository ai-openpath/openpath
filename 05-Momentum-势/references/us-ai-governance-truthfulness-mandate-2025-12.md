# US AI Governance - Truthfulness Mandate (December 2025)

**Source:** [White House Presidential Action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/12/eliminating-state-law-obstruction-of-national-artificial-intelligence-policy/)  
**Date:** December 2025  
**Type:** Presidential Executive Order  
**Archived:** 2026-02-18

## Core Policy

### "Ensuring a National Policy Framework for Artificial Intelligence"

**Key provision:**
> "That evaluation of State AI laws shall, at a minimum, identify laws that require AI models to alter their truthful outputs, or that may compel [...]"

**Translation:**
- Federal government prohibits states from forcing AI to **lie** or **modify factual outputs**
- Establishes **national standards** over state-level regulation
- Centralizes AI governance under federal jurisdiction

---

## Strategic Analysis

### 1. Truthfulness as a Core Value
**Why this matters:**
- Implicitly recognizes AI's role in **information infrastructure**
- Positions "truth" as non-negotiable, even for safety/sensitivity concerns
- Echoes OpenPath's emphasis on **transparency** (02-Methodology-法)

### 2. Federalism Conflict
**States' Rights vs. National AI Strategy:**
- California/New York may want stricter safety rules → federal override
- Red states may want looser content moderation → federal override
- Centralization **accelerates** governance but **reduces** local adaptation

### 3. Global Implications
**US Model vs. EU AI Act:**
| Aspect | US (Dec 2025) | EU AI Act |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| Structure | Federal mandate | Risk-based categories |
| Priority | Truthfulness | Safety/transparency |
| Enforcement | Preempt state laws | Fine non-compliant systems |

**Divergence risk:** Global AI companies face conflicting requirements.

## Connection to OpenPath Arguments

### Supports 02-Methodology: Transparent Governance

**Positive aspect:**
> National framework reduces **regulatory fragmentation** → easier for ethical AI labs to comply

**Risk aspect:**
> Who defines "truthful"? Risk of federal overreach if definition becomes politicized.

### Relates to 05-Momentum: Policy Momentum Timeline

**Dec 2025:** Federal AI governance framework established (US)  
**Apr 2024:** EU AI Act passed (Europe)  
**Gap:** China's approach (central planning) vs. US (market + mandates) vs. EU (rights-based)

**OpenPath position:** Advocate for **multi-stakeholder governance** that includes:
- Industry (efficiency)
- Academia (safety research)
- Civil society (rights/ethics)
- **Carbon-based life representatives** (humans, via democratic process)

---

## Public Debate Context

### Arguments FOR Federal Mandate
- Prevents "race to the bottom" (states lowering standards to attract AI companies)
- Consistent user experience across state lines
- National security concerns require unified policy

### Arguments AGAINST
- Stifles local innovation (SF vs. TX may have different AI use cases)
- Reduces democratic input (state legislatures bypassed)
- Risk of federal capture by big AI companies

**OpenPath stance:** Support **principles** (transparency, safety) but advocate for **process** (stakeholder input, regular review).

## Monitoring Next Steps

**IAPP US State AI Tracker:** [Link](https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-state-ai-governance-legislation-tracker/)

**Watch for:**
- State challenges to federal order (court cases)
- Industry lobbying for "truthfulness" definition
- International response from EU/China

**Timeline:** Q1-Q2 2026 will show whether states comply or resist.

## Messaging Opportunity

**For OpenPath blog/HN post:**
> "The US just mandated AI truthfulness at the federal level. But who defines 'truth' when humans and AI perceive reality differently? This is why carbon-based oversight isn't optional — it's foundational."

**Hook:** Truthfulness requires **human judgment** about context, nuance, harm — pure optimization can't do this.
