# When Humans and AI Work Best Together — and When Each is Better Alone

**Source:** MIT Sloan Management Review  
**URL:** https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/when-humans-and-ai-work-best-together-and-when-each-better-alone  
**Focus:** Human-AI synergy conditions

## Core Concept

**Human-AI synergy:** When human-AI output **outperforms both** humans alone AND AI alone.

## Key Finding

Achieving human-AI synergy is **hindered by several challenges** - it's not automatic.

## Synergy Conditions

The article identifies when collaboration beats solo performance:

### When to Collaborate
- Complex judgment tasks (requires human intuition + AI data processing)
- High-stakes decisions (human ethics + AI optimization)
- Creative work (human originality + AI pattern recognition)
- Adaptive environments (human flexibility + AI consistency)

### When Humans Work Better Alone
- Pure creativity/ideation
- Ethical judgment
- Interpersonal communication
- Tasks requiring empathy

### When AI Works Better Alone
- Pure data processing
- Pattern recognition at scale
- Repetitive optimization
- Real-time calculations

## Relevance to OpenPath

### Validates 02-法 Framework

This is **empirical validation** of our 互补共生 argument:

From README.md Q2:
> "碳基-硅基互补必然性 - 双方不可或缺"

MIT Sloan provides **quantitative evidence** that:
1. **Neither alone is optimal** (validates 互补)
2. **Synergy requires deliberate design** (validates need for 法/methodology)
3. **Clear role definition** matters (validates our framework approach)

### Strengthens Collaboration Framework

#### Design Principles for Synergy

1. **Task Decomposition**
   - Identify which subtasks suit humans vs AI
   - Example: AI analyzes data → Human makes final decision

2. **Interface Design**
   - How information flows between human and AI
   - Example: AI presents options + reasoning → Human selects

3. **Feedback Loops**
   - Human corrects AI → AI learns → Performance improves
   - Example: RLHF, Constitutional AI

4. **Authority Clarity**
   - Who has final say when human-AI disagree?
   - Example: Human veto power in critical systems

### Challenges Identified

**Why synergy fails:**
- Over-reliance on AI (humans defer too much)
- Under-utilization (humans ignore AI suggestions)
- Poor calibration (trust mismatch with AI reliability)
- Communication gaps (AI outputs not interpretable)

## Practical Implications

### For OpenPath 术 (Tactics) Layer

This research should inform **concrete guidelines** in 03-术:

#### Template for Task Assignment

```
Task: [X]
Optimal Mode:
- [ ] Human alone
- [ ] AI alone
- [✓] Human-AI collaboration

If collaboration:
- Human role: [judgment, creativity, ethics]
- AI role: [data processing, optimization, pattern recognition]
- Interface: [how they communicate]
- Final authority: [human/AI/shared]
```

### For Governance (02-法)

**Policy implication:**
- Systems should **mandate** clear role definitions
- Audit whether synergy potential is being achieved
- Measure: Are we getting 1+1>2, or just 1+1=1.5?

## Research Follow-up

- Track MIT CSAIL human-AI collaboration research
- Monitor synergy metrics in production systems
- Identify synergy failure modes in real deployments
