**Category**: Collaboration Framework

## Core Concept

**Human-AI Synergy**: Occurs when human-AI combined output outperforms both humans and AI working alone.

## Key Challenges

- Task allocation (when to use human vs. AI vs. both)
- Complementarity gaps (matching human strengths with AI capabilities)
- Integration friction (workflow design, trust issues)

## Relevance to OpenPath

**Methodology Layer (法)**:
- Tactical framework for "人类+AI" collaboration (持久战 tactical deployment)
- Validates OpenPath's premise: neither pure human nor pure AI is optimal
- Synergy > replacement (符合"共生"理念)

**Strategic Positioning**:
- MIT research backing for symbiotic approach
- Counters AI replacement narrative
- Provides empirical basis for collaboration strategy

## Integration Opportunities

- Add to 02-Methodology "Laying Groundwork for Long-term Cooperation"
- Reference in README Q3 (How humans adapt and learn)
- Use as case study for tactical human-AI task allocation
