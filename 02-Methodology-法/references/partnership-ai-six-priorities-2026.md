## Overview
2026 is critical for AI policy with India's AI Impact Summit, EU Code of Practice, first UN Global Dialogue on AI Governance, and G7 summit. The governance gap between AI capabilities and oversight is widening.

## Six Priorities

### 1. Establish Foundational Infrastructure to Govern AI Agents
**Challenge:** Agentic systems introduce non-reversible actions, open-ended decision-making, and privacy vulnerabilities.

**Actions:**
- Establish transparency standards and secure protocols (e.g., MCP)
- Clarify value chain taxonomy for agents as integrated systems
- Develop monitoring/oversight with privacy protections
- Improve testing infrastructure and evaluations
- Create controlled environments for policy testing
- Deepen liability frameworks

### 2. Strengthen Documentation and Public Reporting
**Challenge:** Fragmented information flow across AI value chain. Upstream developers document without knowing downstream needs.

**Actions:**
- Coordinate documentation artifacts across value-chain layers (compute, cloud, model, deployment)
- Standardize templates tailored to system types/risks
- Strengthen established frameworks (e.g., Hiroshima AI Process Framework)

### 3. Coordinate Internationally Through Shared Baselines
**Challenge:** Governance initiatives proliferating without convergence pathways. Risk of conflicting frameworks.

**Actions:**
- Align on deployment challenges (e.g., cross-border agents)
- Create validated, open evaluation repository
- Define mutual recognition for certification/audit requirements
- Map and link governance initiatives
- Ensure AI Summits drive accountability with measurable outcomes
- Drive interoperability between International Network for Advanced AI Measurement and Global South Network on AI Safety

### 4. Preserve Human Voice and Epistemic Integrity
**Challenge:** AI mediates information, risking erosion of authentic human voice and content discernment.

**Actions:**
- Balance detection tools with content credentialing and public literacy
- Protect human-mediated ecosystems
- Review media economic models in AI-intermediated environment
- Address information access equity divide

### 5. Advance Public Understanding and Workforce Resilience
**Challenge:** Need "assurance literacy" (when to rely on AI) beyond "how to use tools." Lack of data on task-level AI performance.

**Actions:**
- Quantify task-level capabilities across sectors
- Conduct workforce foresight for automation scenarios
- Broaden AI adoption capacity for non-AI-first organizations
- Promote assurance literacy
- Convene educators, companies, civil society, academia for AI education principles
- Unite AI policy and economic policy communities

### 6. Clarify AI Sovereignty Goals
**Challenge:** Complex trade-offs between infrastructure costs, strategic partnerships, and foreign dependencies.

**Actions:**
- Map AI supply chain and dependencies (minerals, energy, infrastructure, models)
- Map where sovereignty adds genuine value vs. new dependencies
- Develop multilateral frameworks for shared digital public infrastructure
- Evaluate environmental tradeoffs
- Ensure public participation mechanisms
- Weigh geopolitical pros/cons of partnerships

## Key Insight
**"Sovereignty shouldn't be measured solely by what a country owns or builds. It should be measured by tangible benefits these decisions deliver to citizens."**

## Context
- 2025 warnings: AI therapists without guardrails, private conversations made public, agentic tools wiping databases
- Gap between AI capabilities and governance oversight widening
- Governance is an ecosystem requiring cross-border, multidisciplinary cooperation
