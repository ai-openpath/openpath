## Core Insights

### COHUMAIN Framework
**Collective HUman-MAchine INtelligence** - A framework treating AI as partner under human direction, not replacement teammate.

**Key Principles:**
- AI integration won't change fundamental organizational intelligence principles
- AI can't fill all same roles as humans (e.g., sensing mood, wider context)
- Best served in "partnership" or facilitation roles, not managerial

**Practical Applications:**
- Nudging peers to check in with each other
- Providing alternate perspectives
- Strengthening connections in remote work

## Psychological Safety & Risk (Allen Brown, Ph.D.)

**Research Finding:** How comfortable people feel taking risks/speaking up varies by AI interaction type.

**Key Tension:** Privacy vs. Utility
- Digital records create evaluation anxiety
- People feel **more vulnerable** when AI evaluates them vs. humans
- Mutual assumption of risk exists in human-human interaction

**Opportunity:** AI as confidence builder
- Help people feel comfortable sharing ideas
- Reduce fear of judgment in classroom/workplace
- Enhance conflict resolution in teams

## Transparency vs. Black Box (Zhaohui Jiang & Linda Argote)

**Surprising Finding:** Black box AI can outperform transparent AI for skilled users.

**Why?**
- High-ability users suffer from **AI aversion** - penalize AI mistakes more than human mistakes
- Transparency increases this tendency
- Skilled users become overconfident when seeing AI decision rules

**When Transparency Helps:**
- Less-skilled users benefit from seeing AI reasoning
- Can learn from AI decision-making rules
- Improves future performance

**Strategic Implication:** One-size-fits-all transparency isn't optimal - match AI explainability to user skill level.

## Strategic Takeaways

1. **AI as Glue:** Missing social connections in remote work can be strengthened by AI facilitation
2. **Partnership, Not Management:** AI excels in supporting roles, not leadership
3. **Context Matters:** Human sensing (mood, context) remains irreplaceable
4. **Adaptive Transparency:** Tailor AI explainability to user expertise level
5. **Trust Building:** Design AI to increase psychological safety, not surveillance anxiety

**Relevance to OpenPath:**
- Validates "分工协作" (division of labor) principle in 01-Philosophy
- Provides empirical basis for human-AI role definition
- Informs governance frameworks around AI evaluation/monitoring
- Demonstrates importance of psychological factors in AI adoption
