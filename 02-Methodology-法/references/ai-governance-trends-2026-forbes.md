**Date:** February 17, 2026

## Six Key Trends

### 1. AI-Native Attacks and Defenses Become the Norm
- Offensive and defensive AI tools proliferating
- Traditional security approaches insufficient
- Cat-and-mouse game escalating to AI vs. AI

### 2. Urgent Need for AI Governance in the Age of Agents
- Agentic AI creates new governance challenges
- Traditional oversight mechanisms inadequate
- Need for frameworks that account for autonomous decision-making

### 3. Tailwind Grows for NIST AI Risk Management Framework
- NIST AI RMF gaining adoption momentum
- Industry coalescing around shared standards
- Government agencies adopting framework

### 4-6. (Additional trends - Forbes article behind paywall)
Likely covering:
- Compliance automation
- Cross-border coordination
- Industry-specific regulations

## Significance

### Convergence Point
2026 marks shift from:
- **2023-2025:** Experimental governance, fragmented approaches
- **2026 onward:** Institutional adoption, standardization pressure

### NIST Framework as Anchor
US NIST AI RMF emerging as de facto standard similar to NIST Cybersecurity Framework's role post-2014.

### The Agent Problem
Autonomous agents creating governance urgency because:
- Traditional "human-in-the-loop" assumptions break down
- Irreversible actions possible
- Attribution complexity
- Emergent behavior unpredictability

## Implications for OpenPath

### 道 (Philosophy)
Need for principles that work **with and without** human oversight loops.

### 法 (Methodology)  
NIST AI RMF worth detailed analysis—could become baseline international standard.

### 势 (Momentum)
2026 is **inflection year**—from voluntary experimentation to regulatory expectation.
