# OpenPath Hourly Update - 2026-02-20 23:40

## Session Focus: Group A & B (AI Origin & Human-Defined Values)

### Key Findings

**1. Constitutional AI Evidence (Anthropic 2022)**
- Successfully verified that even "AI self-improvement" relies on human-defined principles
- RLAIF (RL from AI Feedback) appears autonomous but reward model stems from human constitution
- Two-phase process both require human input:
  - SL phase: AI uses human principles to self-critique
  - RL phase: AI preference model trained on human-defined "harmlessness"

**2. Human Preference Learning (OpenAI 2018)**
- Backflip robot case study: <1000 bits human feedback → complex task mastery
- Key insight: AI doesn't know "what is a backflip" - only knows "which trajectory humans prefer"
- Goal definition entirely from human judgment

**3. Legal Framework Confirmation (15 USC § 9401)**
- US federal law defines AI as system with "human-defined objectives"
- Legislative recognition that human goal-setting is institutional requirement for AI

### Document Status

**No updates needed** - The file `01-Philosophy-道/为什么保留人类.md` already contains:
- Constitutional AI analysis with detailed two-phase breakdown
- OpenAI human preferences case study
- Legal citations (15 USC 9401)
- Model Collapse evidence (Nature 2024)
- Kenneth Reitz's "Digital Collective Unconscious" argument

### Research Limitations

**MCP Server Issue**: `firecrawl` MCP server not available in current environment
- Attempted searches failed
- Pivoted to web_fetch for direct URL retrieval
- Successfully retrieved Anthropic Constitutional AI and OpenAI preference learning resources

### Next Hourly Rotation Suggestion

**Recommended Groups for Next Update:**
- **Group C**: Carbon-silicon collaboration success cases (human creativity + AI execution)
- **Group D**: Anti-opposition thinking (AI as human extension vs. alien species)

**Why these groups:**
- Document has strong philosophical foundation (Groups A/B)
- Needs more concrete 2026 case studies (Group C)
- Anti-opposition framing could be strengthened with recent sources

### Quality Check

**Current document strengths:**
- ✅ Solid legal/research foundation
- ✅ Clear philosophical framework (Origin/Definer/Experiencer)
- ✅ 2026 evidence well-integrated
- ✅ Model Collapse as negative proof of human data necessity

**Areas for future expansion:**
- 🔄 More 2025-2026 AI-human collaboration case studies
- 🔄 International perspectives on AI alignment (beyond US/Anthropic/OpenAI)
- 🔄 Concrete examples of "human defines, AI executes" workflow in production

**Status**: No commit needed (no changes made)  
**Time**: 23:40 CST  
**Philosophy alignment**: ✅ Consistent with "common origin, coexistence" framework
