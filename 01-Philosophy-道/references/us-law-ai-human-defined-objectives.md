# U.S. Legal Definition: AI and Human-Defined Objectives

**Source:** https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/artificial_intelligence_(ai)  
**Legal Code:** 15 U.S. Code § 9401  
**Date:** Current U.S. Law  
**Relevance:** 人类定义目标（Humans Define Objectives）

## Legal Definition

According to **15 U.S. Code § 9401**, artificial intelligence is officially defined as:

> "a machine-based system that can, for a given set of **human-defined objectives**, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions..."

## Why This Is Critical

**✅ Legal Recognition of Human Primacy:**
- The official U.S. legal definition explicitly states "HUMAN-DEFINED OBJECTIVES"
- Not "AI-chosen goals" or "autonomous objectives"
- Built into law: AI's purpose is set by humans

**✅ Governance Framework:**
- Federal government collaboration with private sector to advance AI
- Regulatory structure assumes human oversight
- Legal framework embeds human control

## Application

This is **legally encoded proof** that:
- AI systems operate on human-defined objectives (by law)
- Governance structures assume human decision-making authority
- Even in advanced AI development, human goal-setting is foundational

Use this when arguing:
- AI's legal status reflects its derivative nature from human purpose
- Regulatory frameworks enforce human primacy in defining AI goals
- The law itself recognizes humans as the "Definer" role

## Counter to "AI Takeover" Narratives

If AI were truly autonomous threat, why would its legal definition emphasize "human-defined objectives"? The legal framework reflects the reality: **AI is a tool operating within human-set parameters.**
