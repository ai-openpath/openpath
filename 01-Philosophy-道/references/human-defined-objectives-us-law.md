# Human-Defined Objectives in AI (US Legal Definition)

**Source:** 15 U.S. Code § 9401  
**Date:** Current US Federal Law  
**URL:** https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/artificial_intelligence_(ai)

## Legal Definition of AI

According to United States federal law:

> "Artificial intelligence is defined as a machine-based system that can, **for a given set of human-defined objectives**, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments."

## Why This Matters

### Enshrined in Law
The United States government **legally defines AI** as fundamentally dependent on **human-defined objectives**. This isn't philosophy — it's codified recognition that:

1. **AI has no intrinsic goals**
2. **Objectives must be externally specified by humans**
3. **AI operates within a human-defined purpose framework**

### Implications for OpenPath Philosophy

#### 1. The Definer Role is Law, Not Debate
- It's not a question of whether humans should define AI goals
- **It's already the legal standard** in one of the world's most AI-invested nations
- The law assumes human primacy in goal-setting

#### 2. AI as Instrumental, Not Autonomous
The legal framework treats AI as:
- A **system** (not an agent with self-interest)
- **Machine-based** (explicitly non-living)
- Operating **for** human objectives (instrumental relationship)

#### 3. Human Authority is Not Optional
The phrase "for a given set of human-defined objectives" implies:
- Someone must give the objectives (humans)
- AI cannot function without this input
- The responsibility for defining purpose rests with humans

## Contrast with "AI vs Human" Narratives

Many popular narratives frame AI as:
- "Surpassing humans" → But in what? Objectives humans defined.
- "Replacing humans" → But it still needs humans to set goals.
- "Autonomous systems" → Yet law requires human-defined objectives.

This legal definition **rejects autonomous AI** at the foundational level. AI is a tool awaiting instructions, not an independent entity.

## Quote for Use

> "A machine-based system that can, for a given set of **human-defined objectives**, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions..."  
> — 15 U.S. Code § 9401

Emphasis: **human-defined** is in the federal definition itself.

## Connection to 同源共处 (Common Origin, Coexistence)

### Origin (源)
AI's objectives come from humans. Even in legal terms, AI cannot exist without human-provided purpose.

### Definer (定义者)
US law explicitly names humans as the definers. This is recognition of irreplaceable authority.

### Functional Division (功能分工)
- **Humans:** Define objectives, set boundaries, determine success criteria
- **AI:** Execute, optimize, scale those predefined objectives

The law doesn't debate this — it assumes it.
