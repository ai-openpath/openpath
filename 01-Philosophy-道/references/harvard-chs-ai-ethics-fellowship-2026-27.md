# Fellowship in AI Ethics 2026-2027 (Harvard CHS)

**Institution:** Center for Hellenic Studies, Harvard University  
**Program:** Fellowship in AI Ethics  
**Period:** 2026-2027  
**URL:** https://greece.chs.harvard.edu/news/ai-ethics-26-27  
**Application Deadline:** TBD

## Focus Areas

"Examining the **ethical, societal, and philosophical implications** of artificial intelligence as it continues to evolve."

## Significance

- **Harvard involvement** - top-tier academic institution investing in AI ethics
- **Hellenic Studies** connection - bringing ancient philosophical traditions to modern AI questions
- **Fellowship program** - sustained research support (typically 1 year)
- **2026-2027 timeline** - precisely our critical window

## Philosophical Angle

The Hellenic Studies connection is particularly relevant:
- Ancient Greek ethics (Aristotle, Plato) → virtue ethics, teleology
- Potential bridge between **Western classical philosophy** and **Eastern philosophy** (Confucianism, Daoism)
- OpenPath's 仁道 framework could resonate with virtue ethics tradition

## Relevance to OpenPath

- Validation of **philosophy-first approach** to AI
- Potential collaboration/visibility opportunity
- Evidence that elite institutions recognize **urgency + depth** of AI ethics questions
- May produce frameworks compatible with or complementary to OpenPath
