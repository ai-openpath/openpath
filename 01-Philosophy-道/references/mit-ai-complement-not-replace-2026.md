# MIT Sloan: AI More Likely to Complement, Not Replace Human Workers

**Source:** https://mitsloan.mit.edu/press/new-mit-sloan-research-suggests-ai-more-likely-to-complement-not-replace-human-workers  
**Organization:** MIT Sloan School of Management  
**Date:** 2026  
**Relevance:** 碳-硅分工（Carbon-Silicon Division of Labor）

## Core Finding

MIT Sloan research suggests that **AI is more likely to complement, not replace, human workers**.

## EPOCH Framework: Five Uniquely Human Capabilities

The research outlines **five capability groups that AI struggles to replicate:**

1. **Empathy** - Emotional intelligence and understanding
2. **Presence** - Physical embodiment and spatial awareness
3. **Opinion/Judgment** - Subjective decision-making with values
4. **Creativity** - Novel idea generation and artistic expression
5. **Hope** - Future-oriented motivation and meaning-making

## Why This Matters for OpenPath

**✅ Evidence-Based Distinction:**
- Not defensive ("humans are better")
- Not adversarial ("AI can't do X")
- **Functional**: These are areas where carbon-based cognition has structural advantages

**✅ Complements "AI源于人类" Philosophy:**
- AI learns from human data but struggles with uniquely human traits
- Humans define values, judgment, and meaning
- AI extends human capabilities in areas where it excels (speed, scale, pattern matching)

## Application

Use EPOCH framework to argue:
- **Not about superiority** - about **functional specialization**
- AI doesn't need to replicate these capabilities; humans provide them
- Effective human-AI collaboration leverages both sets of strengths

This research **validates functional division** without falling into defensive posturing.

## Quote-worthy

> "AI struggles to replicate: Empathy, Presence, Opinion/Judgment, Creativity, and Hope"

These aren't random - they're fundamental to human experience and social fabric. AI doesn't need them; **humans contribute them to the system.**
