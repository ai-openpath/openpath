## Core Thesis

> "Human-AI coevolution is a perpetual, iterative process wherein both humans and learning algorithms evolve in tandem, each influencing the evolution of the other."

## Key Insights

**✅ Bidirectional Influence:**
- Humans shape AI through training data, objectives, feedback
- AI shapes human behavior through recommendations, automation, augmentation
- **Neither is static** - both adapt to each other

**✅ Iterative, Not Adversarial:**
- Evolution happens through cooperation and feedback loops
- Not a zero-sum competition for dominance
- Continuous mutual adaptation

## Why This Matters for OpenPath

**Directly supports "同源共处" (Shared Origin Coexistence):**
- Rejects "AI vs Humans" framing
- Positions relationship as **evolutionary partnership**
- Humans retain agency in defining values and goals

**Counters "AI Takeover" Narratives:**
- Coevolution requires **human participation**
- AI doesn't evolve independently - it evolves **with and through** human input
- The framework assumes ongoing human involvement

## Application

Use this to argue:
- Human-AI relationship is **dynamic and collaborative**
- Evolution metaphor is better than conflict metaphor
- Both parties shape the outcome, but **humans define the value framework**

## Important Distinction

"Coevolution" ≠ "equal partnership in all dimensions"
- Humans still define goals and values (Definer role)
- AI still originates from human knowledge (Origin)
- Coevolution describes **process**, not power symmetry

This research shows that **cooperation**, not competition, defines the human-AI trajectory.
