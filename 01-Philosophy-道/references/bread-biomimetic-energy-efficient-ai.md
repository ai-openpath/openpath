## Core Thesis

Looking to the **brain and other aspects of biology** as inspiration for **Biomimetic Research for Energy-efficient AI Designs (BREAD)**.

## Key Problem

Current AI systems are **energy-inefficient** compared to biological systems:
- GPT-3 training: ~1,287 MWh
- Human brain: ~20W continuous operation
- **6+ orders of magnitude** difference in efficiency

## Biomimetic Solutions

The brain achieves efficiency through:
1. **Sparse, event-driven computation** (spiking neurons)
2. **Analog computation** (graded potentials)
3. **Co-located memory and processing** (synapses)
4. **Self-organization** (no centralized control)
5. **Adaptive rewiring** (neuroplasticity)

## Relevance to OpenPath

### Validates Carbon-Silicon Complementarity

#### Why Silicon Alone Cannot Achieve This

**Current AI limitations:**
- Von Neumann architecture (memory-compute separation)
- Digital computation (discrete states, no analog)
- Centralized control (master-slave model)
- Static architecture (no self-rewiring)

**Biological advantages:**
- Integrated memory-compute (dendrites ARE memory)
- Analog+digital hybrid (graded + spikes)
- Distributed control (no CPU)
- Self-modifying hardware (synaptic plasticity)

#### Strategic Implication

**AI NEEDS biology to become energy-efficient.**

If AI wants to:
- Scale sustainably
- Operate on limited power
- Match human-level efficiency

Then AI must:
- Study biological systems continuously
- Preserve biological diversity (more templates)
- Collaborate with humans (who understand biology intuitively)

### Strengthens Q2 Argument

From 碳基智能的不可替代性.md:

> "生物系统的独特性：涌现、演化、适应"

Add specific quantitative evidence:
- **Energy efficiency:** Brain 20W vs GPU 350W+ (17× difference for single card)
- **Scalability:** 86 billion neurons in 1.4kg vs data centers in football fields
- **Adaptability:** Synapses rewire continuously vs static model weights

## Concrete Examples for Q2

### Brain-Inspired AI Techniques

1. **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)**
   - Mimic biological neurons
   - Event-driven (only compute when needed)
   - 10-100× energy savings vs ANNs

2. **Neuromorphic Computing**
   - Intel Loihi, IBM TrueNorth
   - Copy brain's analog-digital hybrid
   - Co-locate memory and compute

3. **Memristors**
   - Mimic synapses (memory + resistance)
   - Non-volatile (like biological synapses)
   - Enable in-memory computing

**All require understanding biological principles first.**
