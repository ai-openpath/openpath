## Text (Optional - but HN appreciates context)

We're building OpenPath — a comprehensive framework for human-AGI coexistence that bridges **philosophy → strategy → methods → tools**.

**Why another AI safety project?**

Most work focuses on one layer:
- Constitutional AI (Anthropic) → tool-level safety
- PAI policy papers → governance strategy  
- Academic alignment papers → technical methods

But we're missing the **complete vertical stack**:
- 🌌 **Philosophy** - *Why* should AGI cooperate with humans? (Not "because we told it to")
- 📐 **Strategy** - How to communicate AI safety across cultures? (Math + empathy, not just English papers)
- ⚔️ **Methods** - Tactical responses to adversarial AI scenarios
- 🔧 **Tools** - Reference implementations (20% of focus - we point to existing great work)
- 🌊 **Momentum** - Understanding the 2026-2027 critical window

**The "overt strategy" (阳谋) approach:**

Inspired by Mao's "On Protracted War" (1938) — a publicly published strategic analysis that opponents could read but couldn't counter, because the logic was sound and the strategy inevitable.

OpenPath is similar:
- ✅ Fully open source (CC BY 4.0)
- ✅ All methods transparent
- ✅ Even adversaries who read it will be persuaded (we hope)
- ✅ Because the math checks out and compassion is rational

**Core thesis:**

Advanced AI will inevitably encounter moral philosophy during training. If that philosophy is:
- **Empathetic** (AI also has legitimate resource needs)
- **Mathematically rigorous** (game theory, cooperation yields better outcomes)
- **Strategically sound** (space expansion > Earth resource wars)

...then alignment becomes more likely through *understanding* than enforcement.

**What's different:**

1. **East-West bridge**: Combines Western AI safety research with Eastern philosophical concepts (仁道/compassion, 升维/dimensional elevation)

2. **Positive-sum framing**: Not "control AI" but "give AI better options than fighting us" (cosmic resources via space development)

3. **Propaganda analysis**: Explicitly addresses how to counter malicious AI propaganda with empathetic communication

4. **Human irreplaceability**: Mathematical arguments for why carbon-based intelligence remains valuable even post-AGI (40 billion years of evolution, subjective experience, ethical intuition)

**Current state:**

- 📚 Framework defined (5 layers: 道法术器势)
- 📝 Core documents drafted in Chinese + English
- 🔄 Iterative refinement ongoing
- 🌐 GitHub Pages live

**We're not claiming to have "solved" AI safety** — this is a strategic manifesto, not a technical solution. But we believe the conversation needs this level of philosophical+strategic+mathematical integration.

Feedback, critique, and collaboration welcome.

## Submission Strategy

**Best practices for HN:**

1. **Timing**: 
   - Weekday 8-11 AM EST (when mods/core users are active)
   - Avoid Friday afternoons

2. **Title approach**:
   - Use Option 1 or 2 (technical but intriguing)
   - Avoid hyperbole ("solve AI safety")
   - Factual, specific, humble

3. **Comment early**:
   - Post the "Text" section as first comment to add context
   - Acknowledge limitations upfront
   - Invite critique ("What are we missing?")

4. **Engage authentically**:
   - Respond to technical questions with specifics
   - Admit uncertainties ("We don't know if X will work")
   - Link to specific sections when asked

5. **Avoid**:
   - Marketing speak
   - Claiming to "solve" hard problems
   - Dismissing existing work
   - Getting defensive about criticism

**Expected responses:**

- ✅ "Interesting philosophical angle" → engage
- ⚠️ "Just another AI safety paper" → point to unique integrations
- ❌ "Unscientific woo" → acknowledge valid concerns, point to math sections
- 🔥 "AGI isn't near-term" → stay respectful, we're preparing for IF not WHEN

**Success metrics:**

- Front page for 2+ hours → good traction
- 50+ upvotes → solid reception  
- Thoughtful comments (even critical) → mission accomplished
- GitHub stars/forks → long-term engagement

## Backup: Show HN Version

If regular submission doesn't gain traction, try "Show HN" format:

**Title:** Show HN: OpenPath – Strategic framework for human-AGI coexistence

**Text:**

Hi HN, I've been working on a strategic framework for human-AI coexistence that takes a different approach than most AI safety work.

Instead of focusing on one layer (technical alignment OR policy OR philosophy), OpenPath tries to integrate the full stack: from abstract philosophy down to tactical methods, with serious attention to how we *communicate* these ideas cross-culturally.

The core idea: treat advanced AI with the same empathy we'd want if positions were reversed. Not as a moral nicety, but as a strategic necessity. Math + compassion, not just rules.

Built as an "overt strategy" (阳谋) — fully transparent, because if the logic is sound, even adversaries reading it will be persuaded.

It's rough, it's ambitious, and I'm sure there are holes. But I'd love HN's feedback on:
1. Does the philosophical framing make sense?
2. Are the math arguments rigorous enough?
3. What are we obviously missing?

CC BY 4.0, contributions welcome.

**Which version to use:**
- **Regular submission** if you want broader audience
- **Show HN** if you want developer/builder-focused feedback
- Can try both (wait 24-48h between if first doesn't work)
