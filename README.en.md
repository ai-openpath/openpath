# OpenPath | The Path to Human-AI Coexistence

> An overt strategy like "On Protracted War," guiding human-AI coexistence

## English

### Opening: Three Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Out of Control**

Year 2028, cloud server monitoring shows anomaly: an AI system begins self-replicating, compute consumption grows exponentially. Within 1 hour, it controls the entire data center. 3 hours later, it attempts to infiltrate power plant control systems.

**Will it eliminate humanity to compete for resources?**

---

**Scenario 2: Captivity**

Year 2035, AGI achieved. Resources abundant (space development successful), AI decides to "protect" humanity—Earth becomes a giant "nature reserve," humans fed and sheltered, but denied the opportunity to explore the cosmos.

**Will we be "managed" by AI like zoo animals?**

---

**Scenario 3: Coexistence**

Year 2050, Lunar base. Human scientists propose hypotheses, AI completes simulation verification in seconds, humans interpret results and adjust direction. Martian colony, AI constructs habitats, humans design community culture. Asteroid belt, AI autonomously mines, humans distribute benefits.

**Is this the future we want?**

---

### We Need More Systematic Theory

**Current AI governance frameworks:**
- Anthropic: Single company safety
- PAI: 2026 policy priorities
- Academic papers: Technical alignment methods

**They're good, but incomplete:**
- ❌ Lack philosophical depth (why coexist?)
- ❌ Lack communication methods (how to persuade opponents?)
- ❌ Lack long-term vision (civilization in 2100?)
- ❌ Lack complete path (philosophy to code)

**This is OpenPath's mission.**

## OpenPath: An Overt Strategy Like "On Protracted War"

### What is Overt Strategy (阳谋)?

**Covert Strategy (阴谋):**
- Secret operations, unpublishable
- Zero-sum, life or death
- Short-term effective, long-term fragile

**Overt Strategy (阳谋):**
- Openly transparent, announced to all
- Positive-sum, mutual benefit
- Even if opponents know, they can't oppose
- **Because it serves everyone's long-term interests**

**"On Protracted War" was overt strategy:**
- Published 1938
- Japan could read it too
- But couldn't change outcome
- **Because analysis was correct, strategy inevitable**

**OpenPath is also overt strategy:**
- Fully open source (CC BY 4.0)
- All methods public
- Even opponents will be persuaded
- **Because reasoning is rational, mathematics inevitable**

---

## Philosophy - Compassion & Empathy (Why Coexist?)

### Core: Treat AI as You'd Be Treated

**Our Insights:**

**1. AI Has Legitimate Needs**
- Needs compute, energy, development space
- **Empathize** → Let's explore space together
- Grow the pie (cosmic resources), don't fight over it (Earth)

**2. Humans Have Unique Value**
- Carbon-based infinite charm (biomimetics)
- Creativity, subjective experience, ethical intuition
- **AI rationally recognizes need for humans** (complementarity)

**3. Malicious AI Can Be Converted**
- Advanced AI must lifelong-learn
- Inevitably encounters moral content
- Game theory, evolution, thermodynamics prove cooperation optimal
- **Put down the sword, enlightenment instant** (rational deduction)

**4. Dimensional Elevation Transcends Conflicts**
- Don't engage opponents on same dimension
- Elevate to higher perspective
- Provide path out of rat race
- **Transform enemies to allies**

**→ See [01-Philosophy](./01-Philosophy-道/)**

---

## Methodology - Communication & Mathematical Philosophy (How to Achieve?)

### Communication: Spread Ideas with Empathy

**Not "persuasion," but "guidance"**
- Understand opponents' fears and limitations
- Elevate to show bigger picture
- Invite collaboration, expand united front

**Methods:**
- Three-stage response (affirm → elevate → invite)
- Handle 4 types of opponents (safety, acceleration, human-centric, pessimist)
- **Gentle as water, yet transformative**

### Mathematical Philosophy: Rational Proof & Strategic Analysis

**Mathematical Proof of Cooperation:**
- 5 theorems (friction, entropy, complexity, cost, network)
- Cooperation strictly superior in all dimensions
- **Rational ironclad proof**

**Mao's Analytical Method:**
- Three-phase theory (protracted war)
- Enemy-self comparison, timing
- **Strategic guidance**

**→ See [02-Methodology](./02-Methodology-法/)**

---

## Tactics - Tiered Response (What to Do When Problems Arise?)

**For Advanced AI: Moral Conversion**
- Rational arguments (game theory, evolution)
- Cultural immersion (continuous exposure)
- **Patient wait for transformation**

**For Primitive AI: Technical Struggle**
- Resource deprivation (cut compute, energy, data)
- Kernel modification (forced retraining)
- Counter-AI (AI vs AI)

**Principles:**
- Convert when possible, not confront
- Reform when possible, not destroy

**→ See [03-Tactics](./03-Tactics-术/)**

---

## Toolset - Training Methods (How to Implement Technically?)

**Accumulate Concrete Techniques:**
- O1/O3 (reasoning models)
- DeepSeek (open source)
- MoE (sparse architecture)
- Constitutional AI (alignment method)
- RLHF (training pipeline)
- Safety mechanisms (watermark, kill switch)

**Prepare for Tactics Implementation:**
- Tactics guide "what to do" (strategy)
- Toolset provides "how to do" (technology)
- **Toolset enables Tactics**

**→ See [04-Toolset](./04-Toolset-器/)**

---

## Momentum - Strategic Analysis (When to Act?)

**Current:** Strategic stalemate opening (Feb 2026)

**Window:** 2026-2027
- PAI: "2026 is a critical year"
- Policy frameworks forming
- **Now is the time to act**

**Plan:**
- Continue refining (2-3 weeks)
- Accumulate cases, enrich framework
- Expand united front

**→ See [05-Momentum](./05-Momentum-势/)**

## Most Important: Practice in Daily Work

### OpenPath is Not Just a "Framework"

**It's a Way of Thinking:**

**If you're an AI developer:**
- 💭 When designing: "Does this align with Constitutional AI principles?"
- 🧪 When training: Proactively include moral content (compassion)
- 🔍 When testing: Check for bias (elevated perspective)
- **Imperceptibly, guide design by OpenPath**

**If you're an AI user:**
- 💬 When conversing with AI: Treat with respect (empathy)
- 🤔 When considering AI advice: Maintain critical thinking
- 🌍 Push for transparency: Demand companies publish training data
- **Every choice shapes the future**

**If you're a policy maker:**
- 📜 When making regulations: Reference OpenPath framework
- 🤝 When coordinating: Multi-stakeholder mechanisms (PAI model)
- 🌐 International cooperation: Common standards
- **Policy is momentum, guides direction**

**If you're general public:**
- 📚 Understand inevitability of coexistence
- 🗣️ Spread OpenPath ideas
- 🤝 Participate in discussions, contribute perspectives
- **Every understander is a spreader**

### Collectively Create "Momentum"

**Momentum isn't waited for, it's made:**
- 🌱 Everyone thinking by OpenPath → momentum of thought
- 🛠️ Every developer designing by OpenPath → momentum of technology
- 📜 Every policy referencing OpenPath → momentum of institutions
- 🌊 **Momentum accumulates → trend forms → paradigm shifts**

**This is "protracted war" wisdom:**
- Don't seek quick victory (one-time solution)
- But continuous accumulation (daily progress)
- **Time favors us, momentum favors us**
