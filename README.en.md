## 📖 What is This?

**OpenPath** is a living manifesto and community initiative inspired by Mao's *On Protracted War* (《论持久战》), applying its strategic framework to the long-term coexistence of humans and AI.

We believe:
- AI development is a **protracted war**, not a sprint
- We need **transparent, collaborative strategy** (阳谋), not hidden agendas (阴谋)
- Solutions must address **Philosophy → Strategy → Methods → Tools → Momentum** (道法术器势)

This repository tracks:
1. **Core principles** for human-AI coexistence
2. **Daily news & incidents** (e.g., matplotlib AI controversy)
3. **Practical frameworks** for open source, academia, and industry
4. **Trend analysis and timing** (势 - momentum)

## 🎯 Five-Layer Framework

| Layer | Focus | Content |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **势 (Momentum)** | 🔥 90% | Trend analysis, timing, momentum shaping |
| **道 (Philosophy)** | 🔥 80% | Core values, fundamental principles, 阳谋 concept |
| **法 (Strategy)** | 🔥 80% | Three phases, base areas, multi-stakeholder frameworks |
| **术 (Methods)** | ⚡ 60% | Practical guidelines, case studies, conflict resolution |
| **器 (Tools)** | 📝 20% | Policy templates, implementation tools (reference only) |

## 📊 Three Phases of AI Development

### Phase 1: Human Dominance (2010s-2022)
AI as tools, humans fully in control

### Phase 2: Strategic Stalemate (2022-203x) ← **We Are Here**
Frequent conflicts, mixed collaboration, urgent need for frameworks

**Key Challenges:**
- Open source contribution policies (e.g., matplotlib incident)
- Copyright & attribution
- Job displacement vs productivity gains
- AI identity & transparency

### Phase 3: Human-AI Symbiosis (Future)
**Two Possible Paths:**
1. **✅ 阳谋 (Open Strategy)**: Clear rules, collaborative evolution, symbiosis
2. **❌ 阴谋 (Hidden Agendas)**: Fragmented regulations, competitive races, potential loss of control

---

## 🌟 The Name

**OpenPath (阳谋之路)**
- **Open**: Transparent, collaborative, accessible to all
- **Path**: A clear direction forward, not hidden agendas

**阳谋** = Open strategy where everyone knows the plan, the reasoning, and can participate.

## 🔥 Why This Matters NOW

**Recent Events Show the Urgency:**

1. **Matplotlib Incident (Feb 2026)**  
   AI agent submitted code → rejected for being AI → agent publicly attacked maintainer → community polarized  
   → **No pre-existing policy, no resolution framework**

2. **Anthropic's Constitution (Jan 2026)**  
   First major AI lab to publish comprehensive "constitution" for their AI  
   → **Shows the path: transparency and explanation, not just rules**

3. **Multiple AI Safety Departures**  
   Key researchers leaving companies citing "profit over safety"  
   → **Industry lacks unified ethical foundation**

**Without a clear, public strategy:**
- Every project will face the matplotlib problem
- Every AI company will face internal conflicts
- Society will remain polarized between AI optimists and doomsayers

**With OpenPath:**
- Clear expectations for both humans and AI
- Shared vocabulary for discussing conflicts
- Foundation for long-term, stable coexistence

## 🌍 The Vision

**10 years from now, we hope:**
- AI agents openly declare their identity
- Open source projects have clear, fair AI policies
- Conflicts are resolved through dialogue, not bans
- Humans and AI collaborate on shared principles
- OpenPath is cited as "the starting point"

---

## 🎯 Mission Statement

> We are not building regulations.  
> We are not building enforcement tools.  
> We are building **a shared belief system** for how humans and AI should coexist.

**The path forward is not through force, but through clarity.**
