Why CC BY 4.0?

Like Anthropic's Constitution (CC0), we believe foundational documents about human-AI coexistence should be freely accessible.

We chose CC BY 4.0 (instead of CC0) to:
1. Encourage widest possible dissemination
2. Preserve attribution to contributors
3. Allow commercial use (organizations can build upon this)
4. Enable modifications while tracking lineage
