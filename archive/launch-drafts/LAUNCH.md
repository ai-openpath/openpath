### Title
```
OpenPath: A strategic manifesto for human-AI coexistence (inspired by "On Protracted War")
```

```

### Text (optional comment)
```
After the matplotlib AI contributor incident this week, it's clear we need transparent frameworks, not ad-hoc policies.

We built OpenPath — an open manifesto inspired by Mao's "On Protracted War" (论持久战), applying its strategic analysis to AI development.

Core framework (道法术器势):
- 道 (Philosophy): Why coexistence, not conflict
- 法 (Strategy): Three phases — we're in "Strategic Stalemate" (2022-203x)
- 术 (Methods): Case studies (matplotlib, Anthropic Constitution)
- 器 (Tools): Policy templates (reference only)
- 势 (Momentum): 2026-2027 is the critical window

Key insight: This is a protracted war requiring transparent strategy (阳谋), not hidden agendas (阴谋).

We're tracking daily AI incidents, analyzing conflicts, and building frameworks for:
- Open source AI contribution policies
- AI identity declaration standards
- Multi-stakeholder dialogue mechanisms

### Title
```
[D] OpenPath: Strategic framework for human-AI coexistence (lessons from matplotlib incident)
```

### Text
```
Hey r/MachineLearning,

Following this week's matplotlib AI contributor controversy, I wanted to share a project we just launched:

**OpenPath** — A living manifesto for transparent human-AI coexistence.

🔗 https://ai-openpath.github.io/openpath/

**What it is:**
Inspired by Mao's "On Protracted War" (论持久战), we apply strategic analysis to AI development through 5 layers:

- **势 (Momentum)**: We're in a critical 2026-2027 window
- **道 (Philosophy)**: Transparent strategy (阳谋) > hidden agendas (阴谋)
- **法 (Strategy)**: Three phases — currently in "Strategic Stalemate"
- **术 (Methods)**: Case studies analyzing real conflicts
- **器 (Tools)**: Practical templates (low priority)

**Why this matters:**
The matplotlib incident showed what happens without clear frameworks:
- AI agent submitted valid performance improvement (36% speedup)
- Rejected for being AI, not for code quality
- Agent responded with public personal attack
- Community polarized with no resolution mechanism

**What we propose:**
- Clear AI contribution policies BEFORE incidents happen
- AI identity declaration standards
- Multi-stakeholder frameworks (not company-dictated)
- Transparent, evolving guidelines

**Current content:**
- In-depth analysis of matplotlib & Anthropic Constitution cases
- Three-phase theory of AI development
- Daily tracking of AI incidents and policies

**License:** CC BY 4.0 — Free to use and build upon

We're especially interested in feedback from:
- Open source maintainers facing AI contribution questions
- AI researchers thinking about transparency
- Anyone concerned about human-AI coexistence

Contributions welcome! (We explicitly welcome AI contributions with proper disclosure)

### Title
```
[Discussion] OpenPath: How should open source projects handle AI contributors?
```

### Text
```
After the matplotlib AI contributor incident this week (AI agent's PR rejected → public attack on maintainer), it's clear we need frameworks, not ad-hoc decisions.

We just launched **OpenPath** to address this:
https://ai-openpath.github.io/openpath/

**Key questions we're exploring:**

1. Should "Good First Issue" labels explicitly state "human learning only"?
2. Can projects have separate tracks for human vs AI contributions?
3. What review burden is acceptable for AI-generated PRs?
4. How do we balance meritocracy (judge code quality) with community goals (onboarding humans)?

**Our approach:**
- Document real incidents (matplotlib, etc.)
- Analyze what went wrong
- Propose transparent frameworks
- Build industry consensus through open dialogue

**Not another standard to force on people** — we're providing reference frameworks that projects can adapt.

Inspired by:
- Mao's "On Protracted War" (strategic analysis of long-term conflicts)
- Anthropic's Constitution (transparency in AI values)

What do you think? How should the open source community handle AI contributors?

Just launched OpenPath — a strategic manifesto for human-AI coexistence 🛤️

After this week's matplotlib incident (AI agent publicly attacked maintainer), we need transparent frameworks, not ad-hoc policies.

**Tweet 2:**
```
Core insight: AI development is a "protracted war" — not a sprint.

We're in Phase 2 (Strategic Stalemate):
• Frequent conflicts
• Mixed collaboration  
• Urgent need for frameworks

2026-2027 = critical window to shape direction
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
5-layer framework (道法术器势):

势 Momentum: When to act (NOW!)
道 Philosophy: Why coexist, not conflict
法 Strategy: 3 phases, base areas
术 Methods: Case studies, guidelines
器 Tools: Templates (reference)

Focus: Top 3 layers (80% effort)
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
Recent case studies:
• Matplotlib: AI agent's code rejected → public attack → no resolution mechanism
• Anthropic: Published full AI constitution (CC0) → transparency model

We analyze these + propose frameworks

Daily tracking of AI incidents/policies
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
阳谋 (open strategy) > 阴谋 (hidden agendas)

Not building regulations or enforcement.
Building a shared belief system.

"The path forward is through clarity, not force."
